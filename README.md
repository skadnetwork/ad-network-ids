# SKAdNetwork id collection

App developers that want to leverage Apples install/conversion attribution API [SKAdNetwork](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork) need to update their apps for iOS14. Apps that display advertisement have to include each advertising partners Apple issued id in the [Info.plist](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/AboutInformationPropertyListFiles.html). (Given that they like to enable measurement for this partner.)

Until there is a centralized place or a tool to curate/update the list this repository can serve as a starting point. If you like to add an id please open a PR.
